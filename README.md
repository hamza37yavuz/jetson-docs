# NVIDIA Jetson Guide and Resources

This repository provides a hardware-based comparative analysis of NVIDIA Jetson platforms, from the earliest Jetson TK1 to the latest Jetson AGX Thor. It includes detailed tables covering CPU, GPU, memory, and AI performance specifications.  

In addition, a step-by-step flashing guide for the Jetson AGX Orin (64 GB Developer Kit) is provided, demonstrating how to set up the device with the latest JetPack release and verify CUDA, TensorRT, and other components after installation.  

The repository is intended as both a technical reference and a practical manual for developers working with NVIDIA Jetson edge AI devices.
